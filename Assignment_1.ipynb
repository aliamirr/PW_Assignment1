    "Q. 14: How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Ans :  Python Memory Manager is responsible to manage memory allocation and deallocation to various processes that        are under execution in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Every python process has two types of memory allocated to it\n",
    "\n",
    "       1) Static Memory\n",
    "       2) Dynamic Memory\n",
    "       All the functions we declare in python code has each of these memory associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Static Memory Allocation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       Whenever a new function or class is declared it is very common to have some variable declaration inside            them, these declarations are associated with the function itself and do not change in the runtime. \n",
    "       They occupy a fixed memory size. Hence these are stored in the stack area.\n",
    "\n",
    "       For every function call in python, there is a structure maintained in the memory of the process. \n",
    "       This structure is called a function block. Python memory manager maintains a stack of such function blocks. \n",
    "       When a function is called its function block is pushed onto this stack and on return, \n",
    "       the same block is popped from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Dynamic Memory Allocation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       The second type of memory available in a program is called heap memory. The heap memory is separate from the        static stack memory, \n",
    "       as this memory can be dynamically requested(allocated) and released(deallocated) in runtime. \n",
    "       The memory size required for such variables cannot be determined beforehand, and hence it is called dynamic        memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Python garbage collection\n",
    "       The Python garbage collector handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically in Python. \n",
    "       Python developers have designed it to eliminate the need for manual garbage collection. \n",
    "       Garbage collection in Python refers to the interpreterâ€™s memory management process of freeing up unneeded          and undesired memory for our applications."
